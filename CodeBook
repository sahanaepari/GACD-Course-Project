GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

Step 1: Download datasets into "UCI Har Dataset" into working directory
Step 2: Assign each datset to variables

activities = "activity_labels.txt" #contains list of activities 
features = "features.txt" #labels for data
X_test = "X_test.txt"
y_test = "y_test.txt"
subject_test = "subject_test.txt"
X_train = "X_train.txt"
y_train = "y_train.txt"
subject_train = "subject_train.txt"

Step 3: Join datasets

Row bind:
X = X_test,X_train
Y = y_test, y_train
subject = subject_test,subject_train

Column bind: subject, Y, X

Step 4: To get the tidy dataset, select only the subject, code and mean/std of each measurement

Step 5: Label all column names better

Acc -> Accelerometer
Gyro -> Gyroscope
Freq -> Frequency
BodyBody -> Body
Mag -> Magnitude
t -> Time
f -> Frequency
angle -> Angle
gravity -> Gravity

Step 6: the final dataset should have means of each subject and activity. "FinalData.txt" file exported onto GitHub.
